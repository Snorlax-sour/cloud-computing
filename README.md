# Cloud-Native Web Ordering System Project

This project focuses on building a robust and scalable web-ordering system by leveraging **cloud-native principles** and **containerization technologies**. Our core objective is to **integrate** various components into a cohesive, functional system that operates seamlessly.

## Ideal Architecture

The envisioned architecture for this web-ordering system (referred to as "Web-ordering-system-software_engineer" throughout this document) will utilize **Docker** to containerize its fundamental components:

* **Frontend**: Responsible for the user interface and user experience, providing the interactive elements for customers to place orders.
* **Backend**: Handles all core business logic, API services, and interactions with the database, acting as the brain of the system.
* **Database**: A dedicated SQL server (such as PostgreSQL or MySQL) will be used for persistent data storage and retrieval, ensuring data integrity and availability.

**Docker Compose will be employed to orchestrate and manage these interconnected Docker containers, ensuring they can communicate and function together as a unified system.** This approach facilitates independent development, deployment, and scaling of each component.

## Key Technologies

* **Docker**: For containerizing individual application components.
* **Docker Compose**: For defining and running multi-container Docker applications, managing their lifecycle and networking.
* **Web-ordering-system-software_engineer**: The core application being developed, which will be decomposed and containerized. *(移除方括號，直接列出作為技術名稱)*
* **SQL Database**: (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) for data persistence.
